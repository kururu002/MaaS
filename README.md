# MaaS
Myself as a software
# Why MaaS?
We learn on daily basis, by hearing, reading, by experimenting. Unfortunately, only the one that we experienced has a deep enough impact to change our actions. If we learn a concept and want to practice it, we would need the discipline to build it as a habit. 
Software, on the other hand, doesn't need the experience to learn. A line of code change means it acts differently, forever. To continually improve ourselves, we could update the action we respond to a condition, just like the software. This project reminds me to act just like this software.

# How did I come up with this idea?
From the book Principal, and Meditation
