# MaaSW
Myself as a SoftWare
# Why MaaSW?
We learn by hearing, reading, by experimenting on daily basis. Unfortunately, not all of them can make us grow. Mostly, only the ones that we experienced have deep enough impact to change our actions. If we learn a concept and want to practice it, we would need the discipline to build it as a habit. 
Software, on the other hand, doesn't need the experience to learn. A line of code change means it acts differently, forever. To continually improve ourselves, we could update the action we respond to a condition, just like the software. This project reminds me to act just like this software.

# Where did the idea come from?
From the book Principle from Ray Dalio, and Meditation from Marcus Aurelius.
